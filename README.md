-  👁️ Hi, I’m @TeV1014.
-  Pronouns: He / Him.
-  I’m interested in tech hygeine, security, digital medicine, and understanding how to get by without passwords.
-  Fun fact: The ✨Human Consciousness OS✨ predates Macintosh and IBM.
-  My someday maybe box: I would like to work on the creation a self-assembling mRna spliced nano-enhanced wi-fi hotspot-emitting microbes that work on disease remission -         remediation and fortification of organic composition. My only concern is avoiding the limitations of scientific accredidation. Are there any spaceship-spider officionados in    the building?
